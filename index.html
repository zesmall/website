				About Me
			</strong>
		</h2>
		<p>
			Hello World! My name is Zack Smalley and I am currently a student at Florida Gulf
			<br />
			 Coast University. I am studying for a major in Software Engineering, but plan to
			<br />
			 transfer to pursue an Electrical Engineering degree. After graduation from high school
			<br />
			 in Merrimack, New Hampshire I joined the United States Marine Corps and served for 5
			<br />
			 years as a Signals Intelligence Analyst and Operator. I have a background in RF theory,
			<br />
			 communications, analytical work, and basic computing. I am always interested in new adventures and learning new abilities that will aid my success later in life!
			<br />
			<br />
			 I currently reside in Cape Coral, Florida with my wife, Kristen Smalley and a little
			<br />
			 Shiba Inu named Bella and there is a video of them playing together below!
