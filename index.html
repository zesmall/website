      <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
      <p> Hello World! My name is Zack Smalley and I am currently a student at Florida Gulf<br> Coast University. I am studying for a major in Software Engineering, but plan to<br> transfer to pursue an Electrical Engineering degree. After graduation from high school<br> in Merrimack, New Hampshire I joined the United States Marine Corps and served for 5<br> years as a Signals Intelligence Analyst and Operator. I have a background in RF theory,<br> communications, analytical work, and basic computing. I am always interested in  new adventures and learning new abilities that will aid my success later in life!<br><br>
          I currently reside in Cape Coral, Florida with my wife, Kristen Smalley and a little<br> Shiba Inu named Bella and there is a video of them playing together below!
